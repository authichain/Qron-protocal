# QRON
### A Protocol for an Authentic Economy

QRON is an experiment in making **authenticity verifiable**, **engagement meaningful**, and **ownership earned**.

It is not a QR platform.
It is not a loyalty system.
It is not a token-first project.

QRON is a **trust interface**.

---

## What QRON Is

QRON turns a standard, scannable QR code into:

- A verification event
- A moment of engagement
- An optional, earned form of ownership

All in a single scan.

No app required.
No wallet required.
No speculation required.

## Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

These invariants define the system.  
If any are violated, QRON is considered broken.

### 1. QR Comes First
- All interactions begin with a standards-compliant QR code.
- Any phone camera must be able to scan it.

### 2. Verification Before Reward
- No reward, benefit, or collectible exists without authenticity verification.

### 3. Engagement Before Ownership
- Ownership is unlocked only after meaningful interaction.
- Passive extraction is prohibited.

### 4. Ownership Is Optional
- Wallets unlock additional value, never baseline access.

### 5. Visual Integrity
- Artistic or dynamic effects must never compromise scannability or trust.

### 6. Human Respect
- No dark patterns.
- No forced scarcity.
- No deceptive mechanics.

## What QRON Is Not

QRON must never become:

- A QR replacement NFT
- A wallet-gated experience
- A speculation-first system
- A growth hack
- A token economy disguised as UX

---

## Canonical Demo (“The One Code”)

QRON has a single reference experience.

1. A user scans a QR code
2. Authenticity is verified
3. An experience is unlocked
4. Ownership is optionally offered

This demo is the source of truth.
All implementations derive from it.

## Project Status

- No funding
- No token launch
- No company (yet)

This repository exists to:
- Preserve intent
- Attract aligned contributors
- Prevent vision drift

---

## Call for Contributors

QRON is looking for people who care about:

- Trust before growth
- Constraints before hype
- Earned value over extraction

If you believe:
- Ownership should be optional
- Verification should precede reward
- Technology should respect humans

You may belong here.

Read the spec.
Open an issue.
Propose thoughtfully.

No promises.
No hype.
Just alignment.

## Stewardship

QRON is maintained by its Founding Architect.

Foundational changes require explicit discussion and approval.
No silent drift.
