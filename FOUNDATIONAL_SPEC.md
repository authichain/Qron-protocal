# QRON — Foundational Specification
## A Protocol for an Authentic Economy

### Status
Authoritative · Version 1.0 · Maintained by the Founding Architect

---

## 1. Purpose

QRON exists to create an **authentic economy** where:

- Authenticity is verifiable
- Engagement precedes reward
- Ownership is earned, not extracted
- Digital experiences remain anchored to real-world truth

QRON is not a growth hack, a speculation engine, or a loyalty gimmick.
QRON is an interface for trust.

## 2. Non-Negotiable Invariants

The following must always be true.  
Violating any of these constitutes a protocol failure.

### 2.1 QR-First Interaction
- All experiences begin with a standards-compliant, scannable QR code.
- No wallet, app, or account is required to scan or verify.

### 2.2 Verification Before Reward
- No reward, collectible, or benefit may be issued without successful authenticity verification.

### 2.3 Engagement Before Ownership
- Ownership (NFTs, badges, rights) is unlocked only after meaningful engagement.
- Passive extraction is prohibited.

### 2.4 Ownership Is Optional
- Wallets unlock *additional* value, never baseline access.
- Core functionality must remain wallet-free.

### 2.5 Visual Integrity
- Artistic or dynamic effects must never compromise scannability or trust signals.

### 2.6 Human Respect
- No dark patterns
- No forced scarcity
- No deceptive mechanics

## 3. Prohibited Outcomes

The following must never occur:

- Replacing QR codes with NFTs
- Wallet-gated verification
- Rewards without verification
- Speculation-first mechanics
- Token value as the primary product

---

## 4. Explicitly Optional Components

The following may evolve or be replaced, provided invariants are preserved:

- Blockchain network
- Token mechanics
- Rarity schemas
- AR depth and fidelity
- Gamification systems

---

## 5. Amendment Process

Foundational changes require:

1. Written proposal
2. Explanation of the invariant being modified
3. Justification for change
4. Explicit approval from the Founding Architect

No silent drift.
